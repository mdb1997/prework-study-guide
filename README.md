# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this Prework Study Guide in order to help new bootcamp students who were going through the Prework. It involves notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built this project in order to summarize some important keynotes for the new students as all the info provided in Prework can be quite overwhelming at times. This study guide helps to solve some small inconveniences such as rifling through the modules to find answers and as a quick study sheet to use themeselves. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I also learned how to use a command line and VS code.

There will be a console tab to click on and on that page will show a list of topics we learned and a suggestion of what to study first.
